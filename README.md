This app helps to measure a distance between two points using GPS. Mobile phones nowadays use a combination of things like satellites, cell towers and wifi to get location.

This web app uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app records the location at point A and then at point B and then it will do the calculation for you. It  measure the straight line distance between two points. For locations that are nearby this works, otherwise, we need to use the great circle distance instead (maybe using the Haversine formula)
